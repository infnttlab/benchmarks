Current directory /CT (Computed Tomography) contains the following directories:

	/dataset: the dataset used for Elena's thesis.
			From "Veste", slice 400 in a variety of sizes.

        /parrec_cuda: CUDA version of parrec, Version 3 in Elena's thesis.
			num_thread & num_blocks only used for zero_padding and FFT.
			Dim_block is the real parameter; optimal value 16.
                        
			Compile with nvcc -O3 -arch=sm_32 -o parrec *.cu -lm -lcufft
                        Run with ./parrec 400 400 16 32 16
                        
			to go from slice 400 to slice 400 and use 16 blocks, 32 threads
			and dim_block=16.	
                        Current slice has size 2048.

	/parrec_seriale: C version of parrec, modified by Elena to give input
			from command line, not inside file
			
			Compile with gcc -O3 -o parrec_c *.c -lm -lfftw3	
			Run with ./parrec_c 400 400
			
			to go from slice 400 to slice 400
                        Current slice has size 2048.
			
			Dir also contains a script (new_parrec_c_launch_1slice.sh)
			to perform parrec many times and save average execution time 
			and sigma of the reconstructed images (via plot_differences_4bash.py)


	/parrec_omp: OpenMP version of parrec (by Lucia)
			
			Compile with gcc -O3 -fopenmp -o parrec_omp *.c -lm -lfftw3
			Run with ./parrec_omp 
			
			for 1...4 threads. To modify nthreads: line 317 in REC_FUNCTIONS.c
                        Current slice has size 256.
